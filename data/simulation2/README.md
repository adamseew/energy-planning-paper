# Simulation data from the PPRZ logs
The original files are in the directory [simulation1](../simulation1).

The mission was the original agricultural survey with Paparazzi autopilot and Opterra fixed-wing UAV (credit goes to **Amit** Ferenz Appel and **Hector** Garcia de Marina).

Files here have been cut to the actual survey. You can find how to interpret the data here, so next time you don't forget; as you always do.
