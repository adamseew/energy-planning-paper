Mission planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in outdoor scenarios such as precision agriculture, search and rescue, and surveillance is a challenging task. It usually requires advanced levels of autonomy along with strictly limited energy budgets--with the typical instance being a UAV used to inform its grounded counterparts of patterns detected while flying. Currently, UAVs flying outdoors are often semi-autonomous, in the sense that the mission is static and usually defined using a mission planning software~\cite{daponte2019review}. Such a state of practice has prompted us to propose an \emph{energy-aware dynamic mission planning algorithm} for UAVs that highlights the increasing \emph{computational demands} and their relation to the energy consumption, path, and autonomy.

Energy planning algorithms for mobile robots broadly are not a new concept and have been extensively studied, in that they are correlated to such topics as trajectory generation and path planning. Generally, these algorithms account for the energy due to the trajectory, by e.g., maximizing the operational time~\cite{wahab2015energy}, but in practice apply to a narrow class of robots~\cite{kim2005energy}, and focus on optimizing motion control for such robots~\cite{kim2008minimum}, despite compelling evidence for these systems' energy being influenced by the computations over bare motion~\cite{mei2004energy}. For UAVs specifically, rotorcrafts have equally gained research interest in terms of algorithms for energy-efficient trajectory generation~\cite{morbidi2016minimum,kreciglowa2017energy}. Further, past mission planning approaches also limit to the trajectory~\cite{mei2004energy,mei2005case,mei2006deployment}, and to the class of robots~\cite{sadrpour2013mission,sadrpour2013experimental}. Yet, computations of such systems are only expected to increase in the near future. Unlike the past approaches, the algorithm presented here attempts to combine and generalize some of these technical breakthroughs and correlate the extensively studied energy planning to the growing computational demands.

The proposed algorithm alters the energy consumption dynamically by means of mission-specific parameters: the Quality of Service (QoS) of the onboard computations, and the trajectory-explicit equations (TEEs) of the path. Our goal is a mission extension by optimizing both QoS and TEEs as the UAV flies and its batteries drain. The algorithm optimizes QoS requiring the UAV to include robot operating system (ROS) nodes. It optimizes TEEs--an abstraction of the path to follow--and guides the UAV using a vector field that converges smoothly to the path. Physically, one can use a feature detection node and a set of ellipses, with the algorithm controlling the processing rate and the length of the semi-major and -minor axis. Data using a commercial fixed-wing UAV indicates a potential extension of up to 13 minutes over an hour by merely switching to the lowest QoS.

The algorithm relies on the assumptions of the mission--a time-varying path and a set of tasks the UAV is supposed to perform along the TEEs and QoS parameters constraints--being \emph{periodic} and \emph{uncertain}. The periodicity is directly observed, by e.g., the UAV flying in repetitive patterns, and the uncertainty accounts for the environmental interference with e.g., a fixed-wing UAV drifting due to windy weather. We propose the Fourier analysis to address the periodicity assumption--being the mission periodic, we expect the energy to evolve also periodically--and a state estimator to cope with the uncertainty assumption. The algorithm selects the controls (the QoS and TEEs) using a modified tube-based output model predictive control (MPC), ensuring that state estimation error does not result in transgression of the control and state constraints.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The dynamic mission planning problem is set in Section~\ref{sec:prob}, along a suitable model for the energy and position of the UAV. The algorithm that uses the model and solves the problem is proposed in Section~\ref{sec:algo}. Section~\ref{sec:experimental} presents a fixed-wing UAV flying in an agricultural scenario showcasing the performance. The paper finishes with some conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:prob}

We consider the problem of dynamic mission planning for a precision agriculture fixed-wing UAV. Precision agriculture is rising in demand for reducing waste, costs, and resources while increasing outputs and utilization~\cite{hajjaj2014review}, with mobile robots being increasingly used for e.g., harvesting~\cite{qingchun2012study,dong2011development, de2011design, aljanobi2010setup, li2008analysis, edan2000robotic}. In practice, complex monitoring strategies are often implemented utilizing UAVs and are usually required for preventing damage and ensuring better crop quality~\cite{puri2017agriculture}. 

The UAV flies in ellipses shifted in time--a survey pattern optimized for the craft's dynamics--detects obstacles using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and informs grounded mobile robots employed for future harvesting.

\subsection{Position and energy state}
\label{sec:model}

We use the state to estimate the UAV's position in space and the energy in time. Starting with a position $\mathbf{p}\in\mathbb{R}^3$ in the 3D Euclidean space w.r.t. some inertial navigation frame $\mathcal{O}_W$, we build a guidance action--which allows the \emph{position evolution} along the 3-axis--to the path to follow using a vector field~\cite{de2017guidance}. The path is a set of generic continuous twice differentiable TEEs $\varphi_k:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. To this end, the TEE is satisfied $\varphi(\mathbf{p})\rightarrow 0$ for all the approaching points.

We build the \emph{energy evolution} $\mathbf{q}\in\mathbb{R}^j$ using Fourier analysis (the meaning of $j$ is clarified to the reader in Subsection~\ref{sec:energy-model}) and decompose such evolution in the energy due to the trajectory (depending on TEEs), and computations (on QoS)--an approach adapted from our earlier work on computational energy analysis~\cite{seewald2019coarse, seewald2019component}, and energy estimation of a fixed-wing UAV~\cite{seewald2020mechanical}.

\subsection{Position evolution and guidance action}
\label{sec:position}

We consider a non-holonomic 2D model of the UAV flying at an assigned altitude $h\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ (the requirement is eased in Section~\ref{sec:algo} to a set of altitudes $\mathbf{h}$)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uav-kinem}\begin{cases}
  \dot{\mathbf{p}}(t)&=s\Psi(\psi(t))+\mathbf{d}(t)\\
  \dot{\psi}(t)&=u(\mathbf{p}(t))
\end{cases},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{p}\in\mathbb{R}^2$, $s\in\mathbb{R}$ is the airspeed (assumed constant), $\psi\in(-\pi,\pi]$ the attitude yaw angle and $\Psi(\psi)=\begin{bmatrix}\cos{\psi} & \sin{\psi}\end{bmatrix}^T$, $\mathbf{d}\in\mathbb{R}^2$ is the wind vector (assumed $\|\mathbf{d}\|<s$, i.e., the constant airspeed is greater than the norm of the wind), and $u\in\mathbb{R}$ the guidance action--the angular velocity $\dot{\psi}$.

Let us define $\mathcal{P}_k$, the area that discloses all the possible deviations form the $k$-th TEE 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:area}
  \mathcal{P}_k:=\{\mathbf{p}:\underline{c}_k\leq\varphi_k(\mathbf{p})\leq\overline{c}_k\},
\end{equation}
where $\underline{c}_k\in\mathbb{R}_{\leq 0},\overline{c}_k\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ are the constraints: $\underline{a},\overline{a}$ returns the upper and lower bound of $a$ from the user-defined mission specification, a lookup table.

The algorithm uses the concept to select $c$ with the highest energy value under the energy budget constraints. Assume at time $k$ the algorithm selects the TEE $\varphi_k$ with the highest energy value being $c_k$, we design a guidance action $u$ that heads to such TEE by minimizing the norm $\|\varphi_k(\mathbf{p})-c_k\|$.

Let us define $\varPhi:=\varphi_k(\mathbf{p})-c_k$. The direction to the TEE to follow can be expressed as the desired velocity vector
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pd}
  \dot{\mathbf{p}}_d(\mathbf{p}):=E\nabla\varPhi-k_e\varPhi\nabla\varPhi,\,\,\,E=\begin{bmatrix}
    0&1\\-1&0
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\nabla\varPhi\in\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined as the gradient of $\varphi$ at the point $\mathbf{p}$ (i.e., its vector field), $E$ specifies the tracking direction, and $k_e\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ the gain to adjusts the speed of convergence.

The direction the velocity vector $\dot{\mathbf{p}}_d$ is pointing at is generally different from the course heading $\chi\in(-\pi,\pi]$ due to the atmospheric interference.

Let us further define $\hat{\mathbf{p}}:=\mathbf{p}/\|\mathbf{p}\|$, the desired course heading rate $\dot{\chi_d}$ is computed by sensing the position $\mathbf{p}$, the ground velocity $\dot{\mathbf{p}}$, and is expressed
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chid}\begin{split}
  &\dot{\chi}_d(\mathbf{p})=-E\frac{\dot{\mathbf{p}}_d}{\|\dot{\mathbf{p}}_d\|^2}\cdot\\
  &\hspace{2ex}\left( E\hat{\dot{\mathbf{p}}}_d\hat{\dot{\mathbf{p}}}_d^TE\left( (E-k_e\varPhi)H(\varPhi)\dot{\mathbf{p}}-k_e\nabla\varPhi^T\dot{\mathbf{p}}\nabla\varPhi \right) \right)^T,
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
where $H(\cdot)$ is defined as the Hessian operator and $\dot{\mathbf{p}}_d:=\dot{\mathbf{p}}_d(\mathbf{p})$ for brevity; the physical meaning is that the curvature of the desired trajectory has to be known in order to be tracked.

The guidance action can be expressed
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uav-cont}
  u(\mathbf{p},\psi)=\frac{\|\dot{\mathbf{p}}\|}{s\cos{\gamma}}\left( \dot{\mathbf{\chi}}_d+k_d\hat{\dot{\mathbf{p}}}^TE\hat{\dot{\mathbf{p}}}_d \right),
\end{equation} 
where $\gamma=\cos^{-1}{\left( \hat{\dot{\mathbf{p}}}^T\Psi(\psi) \right)}$ is the sideslip angle, $k_d\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ adjusts the speed of convergence of $\dot{\mathbf{p}}_d$, and $\dot{\chi}_d:=\dot{\chi}_d(\mathbf{p})$ is given in Equation~(\ref{eq:chid}).

\subsection{Energy evolution due to trajectory}
\label{sec:energy-model}

The energy evolution analysis necessitates the following realistic assumption.
\begin{assm}\label{assm:periodic} The position evolution is periodic, in the sense that it presents repetitive patterns.
\end{assm}
Formally, given two time instants $k_1,k_2\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that $k_1>k_2$ and a value $n\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, there exist an arbitrary constant displacement $e\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \|\mathbf{p}(t)-\mathbf{p}(t+n)\|= e\,\,\,\forall t\in\{k_1,...,k_2\}.
\end{equation}
We show in Section~\ref{sec:experimental} the assumption being eased in practice to a set $\mathbb{E}\subset\mathbb{R}$.

Let us consider a Fourier series $f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ of an arbitrary order $r\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
  f(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{r}{a_n\cos{\frac{nt}{\xi}}+b_n\sin{\frac{nt}{\xi}}},
\end{equation}
where $\xi\in\mathbb{R}$ is the characteristic time, and $a_n, b_n\in\mathbb{R}$ for $n\in\{0,\dotsc,r\}$ the Fourier series coefficients.

The non-linear model in Equation~(\ref{eq:fourier}) can be expressed using an equivalent linear time-invariant state-space model
\begin{equation}\label{eq:state-perf}\begin{cases}
  \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t)&=A\mathbf{q}(t)+B\mathbf{u}(t)\\%+w(t)\\
  y(t)&=C\mathbf{q}(t)%+v(t)
\end{cases},\end{equation}
where $y(t)\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is the instantaneous energy consumption of the system being controlled. We prove formally in the Theorem~\ref{thm:state-vs-energy} the instantaneous energy being obtained as a linear combination of the state. The control $\mathbf{u}$ along with the input matrix $B$ are defined later in Subsection~\ref{sec:control-action}, the state $\mathbf{q}$ mimics the original Fourier series coefficients, and

\begin{equation}\label{eq:state-details}\begin{split}
  \mathbf{q}(t)&=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
    \alpha_0 & \alpha_1 & \beta_1 & \cdots & \alpha_r & \beta_r
  \end{array}\right]^T,\\
  A&=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
    1&    &       &  \\
     & A_1&       &  \\
     &    & \ddots&  \\
     &    &       & A_r 
  \end{array}\right],\,A_n=\begin{bmatrix}0 & \frac{n}{\xi} \\ -\frac{n^2}{\xi^2} & 0\end{bmatrix},\\
  C&=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
    1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & 0
  \end{array}\right],
\end{split}\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{q}(t)\in\mathbb{R}^j$ given $j:=2r+1$, $A\in\mathbb{R}^{j\times j}$ is the state transmission matrix, and $C\in\mathbb{R}^j$ is the output matrix. In matrix $A$, the first value is one, $A_n$ farther on the diagonal, and zero for the remaining.

We further model the system of Equation~(\ref{eq:state-perf}) plus disturbances with the following discrete time model
\begin{equation}\label{eq:state-unct}
  \begin{cases}
  \mathbf{q}_{k+1}&=A\mathbf{q}_{k}+B\mathbf{u}_{k}+\mathbf{w}_k\\
  y_k&=C\mathbf{q}_k+v_k
  \end{cases},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{w}_k\in\mathbb{R}^j,v_k\in\mathbb{R}$ account for unknown state and output disturbances. In the case of the system behaving ideally (i.e., with zero disturbances), we expect a set of states evolving accordingly to their output. Such observation is summarized in the following Lemma.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:state-vs-energy}
  Suppose the system of Equation~(\ref{eq:state-unct}) evolves with no disturbances ($\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{0},v=0$) and Assumption~\ref{assm:periodic} holds, then
  \begin{equation}
    \|\mathbf{q}_{k,0}\|\geq\|\mathbf{q}_{k,1}\|\iff y_{k,0}\geq y_{k,1}.
  \end{equation}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{center}\vspace{.2cm}``\emph{The easy proof is trivial and is left as an exercise to the reader :P}''\vspace{.6cm}\end{center}
\end{proof}

\begin{center}\vspace{.2cm}---\emph{from here on work in progress}---\vspace{.6cm}\end{center}

\subsection{Energy evolution due to computations}
\label{sec:computations-model}

A computational energy model is built using \powprof{}, an open-source modeling tool that measures empirically software configurations and builds an energy model, presented in authors' previous work~\cite{seewald2019coarse}. Specifically, the tool builds a multivariate linear interpolation which is accessed online at the hand of a lookup table in the optimal control algorithm. The system is modeled as follows. An existing ROS system composes several computationally expensive ROS nodes, allowing to vary the number of computations changing some node-specific quality of service (QoS) values via ROS parameters. The tool builds the energy model using mission specification which, besides other mission parameters, specifies per each ROS node a QoS range.

Suppose the system is composed of $\sigma$ computationally expensive ROS nodes. Let us define the computational control action
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qos-def}
  \mathcal{C}_k:=\left\{u:u\in\text{QoS}_n(k)\,\forall\,n\in\{0,\dots,\sigma-1\}\right\},
\end{equation}
where $\text{QoS}_n(t):\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ returns the $n$-th QoS value at time $t$, and $\mathcal{C}_k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^\sigma$ the set of $\sigma$ QoS values the system is composed of at time $k$. Let us further define $g:\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\times\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ as the instantaneous energy value obtained interrogating \powprof{}. The instantaneous computational energy component can be defined
\begin{equation}\label{eq:energy-comp}\begin{split}
  y_k^c:&=g\left(\text{QoS}_0\left(k\right),\dots,\text{QoS}_{\sigma-1}\left(k\right)\right)=g\left(\mathcal{C}_{k}\right).\\
\end{split}\end{equation}

The QoS parameters $\mathcal{C}_k$ can be subject to different constraints at different states. Physically, this means that the robot can perform the ROS nodes within different QoS ranges while flying different phases of a mission
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qos-lims}\begin{split}
  \underline{\text{QoS}}_n(k)\leq \,&\text{QoS}_n(k)\leq \overline{\text{QoS}}_n(k),\\
  &\forall n\in\{0,\cdots,\sigma-1\},
\end{split}\end{equation}
where the values $\underline{\text{QoS}}_n(k),\overline{\text{QoS}}_n(k)$ are retrieved from the mission specification.

The control action is built in two steps. Equation~(\ref{eq:qos-def}) defines the control due to the computations. The control due to the trajectory is specific to the system being analyzed, for instance on the model of the fixed-wing craft in~(\ref{eq:uav-kinem}), along its control in Equation~(\ref{eq:chid})~and~(\ref{eq:uav-cont}). A generalization which accounts for the variations in the TEE $\varphi$ of a generic model by means of the TEEs parameters is derived in the following subsection.

\subsection{Control action}
\label{sec:control-action}

Given a generic trajectory equation $\varphi$, the trajectory can be modeled by $\rho$ TEE parameters $\mathcal{M}\in\mathbb{R}^\rho$, e.g., the constants of a linear function, the radius of a circle, and semi-major and minor axis of an ellipse. Let us define $\mathbf{u}_{k,n}:=\{u_{k,0},\dots,u_{k,n-1},u_{k,n}^0,u_{k,n+1},\dots,u_{k,\rho_k-1}\}$, the set of these parameters can be expressed
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tee-def}\begin{split}
  \mathcal{M}_k:=\{u_{k,n} : \,
  &\varphi_k(\mathbf{p}_{k,n}^0,\mathbf{u}_{k,n})\in\mathcal{P}\\
  &\forall n\in\{0,\dots,\rho_k-1\}\},
\end{split}\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{p}_k^0$ is any optimal point which let the trajectory explicit function $\varphi_k$ converge under any optimal TEE parameter $u_k^0$. Physically $\mathcal{M}_k$ contains all the controls generating the points over the area $\mathcal{P}$ defined in Equation~(\ref{eq:area}). 

The explicit trajectory equation $\varphi_k$ can be different at different states $k$, meaning the vector field and guidance action, from Equation~(\ref{eq:pd})~and~(\ref{eq:uav-cont}) respectively, will account for the sudden change of trajectory during the mission.

It is worth considering that the number of parameters at state $k$ is a parameter of the state. This is for the sake of generality, as the mission specification might contain different explicit equations for different states. For instance, the fixed-wing craft might follow an ellipse function throughout the mission and heading a linear function while landing. 

The TEE parameters and QoS, $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ defined in Equation~(\ref{eq:tee-def})~and~(\ref{eq:qos-def}), are incorporated in the system in Equation~(\ref{eq:state-unct}) using the input matrix
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{u}_k=\left[\begin{array}{c}
    g\left(\mathcal{C}_k\right) \\\hline \mathcal{M}_k
  \end{array}\right],\,\,\,
  B=\left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
    1 & \vline & 0 & \cdots & 0\\\hline
    0 & \vline & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    \vdots & \vline & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
    0 & \vline & 0 & \cdots & 0
  \end{array}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{u}_k\in\mathbb{R}^l$ is the control given $l:=1+\rho$, and $B\in\mathbb{R}^{j\times l}$ is the input matrix from Equation~(\ref{eq:state-perf})~and~(\ref{eq:state-unct}). Moreover, the first column in the first row of the input matrix is $1$, while all the other items are $0$. This adds the computational model component to the energy evolution in the system. The energy due to the change of explicit trajectory equation parameters is not directly added to the system, which however will update the reading from the sensors $y^s$ defined in Subsection~\ref{sec:state-est} and adjust the energy evolution accordingly.

\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algo}

The main goal of the algorithm is to find an optimal control action $\mathbf{u}^0$ for the current state $\hat{\mathbf{q}}$--estimated from sensors' measurements--from the optimal control law $\mathbf{u}^0=:\kappa(\hat{\mathbf{q}})$. This is achieved by solving online a finite horizon optimal control problem by the hand of a modification of a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm~\cite{rawlings2017model}.

Let us proof formally an important finding from Section~\ref{sec:model} extensively used in the algorithm.

% [Ad:] I am actually not entirely sure if the thm should be here (and if it makes sense). Aka proving formally that what we do is actually what we expect; so perhaps it does make sense but I would like your opinion before spending time on the demonstrations... Same for the lemma.
% [Ad:] And here I had the doubt if to place the thm just straight after the lemma or here. I places it here as this is actually the main contribution -> the energy model working. Does it make any sense?

\begin{thm}\label{thm:state-vs-energy}
  Consider a continuously differentiable function $\varphi_k:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ at a time instant $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.
  Assume Assumption~\ref{assm:periodic} holds, the robots is free to move in $\mathcal{P}$ defined in~(\ref{eq:area}), and is following $\varphi$ with the direction $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_d$ defined in~\ref{eq:pd}. Likewise in Lemma~\ref{lem:state-vs-energy}, the model behaves ideally. 
  Then, the instantaneous energy consumption is a linear combination of the state
  \begin{equation}
    y_k=C\mathbf{q}_k=\sum_{n=0}^r{\alpha_n},
  \end{equation}
  where $\alpha_n\in\mathbf{q}_k$ are the $r+1$ state's components at $k$ with $r$ being a preassigned arbitrary order from~(\ref{eq:fourier}), and $C$ is described in Equation~(\ref{eq:state-details}).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  *\\
\end{proof}

\subsection{State estimation}
\label{sec:state-est}

As the environment uncertainty and measurement error evolve in a normal distribution, we use a Kalman filter~\cite{stengel1994optimal, simon2006optimal} for the purpose of state estimation. 

The prediction is done using
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:kalman-pred}\begin{align}
  \hat{\mathbf{q}}_{k+1}^-&=A\hat{\mathbf{q}}_{k}+B\mathbf{u}_k,\label{eq:kalman-pred1}\\
  P_{k+1}^-&=AP_kA^T+Q,\label{eq:kalman-pred2}
\end{align}\end{subequations}
where $\hat{\mathbf{q}}_k^-,\hat{\mathbf{q}}_k\in\mathbb{R}^j$ depicts the estimate of the state before and after measurement (or simply estimate), and $P_k,P_k^-\in\mathbb{R}^{j\times j}$ the error covariance matrix (i.e., the variance of the estimate). 

The estimation of the state and the update of the predicted output is done using
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:kalman-est}\begin{align}
  K_k&=(CP_{k+1}^-C^T+R)^{-1}(P_{k+1}^-C^T),\\
  \hat{\mathbf{q}}_{k+1}&=\hat{\mathbf{q}}_{k+1}^-+K_k(y_k^s+y_k^c-C\hat{\mathbf{q}}_{k+1}^-),\label{eq:kalman-est2}\\
  P_{k+1}&=(I-K_kC)P_{k+1}^-,\\
  \hat{y}_k&=C\hat{\mathbf{q}}_{k+1},\label{eq:kalman-est4}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $K_k\in\mathbb{R}^j$ is the gain of the Kalman filter, and $I$ the identity matrix. $y_k^s,y_k^c$ are the instantaneous energy readings: $y_k^s\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ the robot sensor, i.e., the energy due to the trajectory, and $y_k^c$ the energy of a given software configuration described in Equation~(\ref{eq:energy-comp}). The noise covariance matrices $Q\in\mathbb{R}^{j\times j},R\in\mathbb{R}$ indicates the uncertainty and measurement error covariance respectively, and $\hat{y}_k\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is the estimated energy.

Equations~(\ref{eq:kalman-pred}--\ref{eq:kalman-est}) converge to the predicted energy evolution as follows. An initial guess of the values $\hat{\mathbf{q}}_0,P_0$ is derived empirically from collected data. It is worth considering that an appropriate guess of these parameters allows the algorithm to converge to the desired energy evolution in a shorter amount of time. The tuning parameters $Q,R$ are also derived from the collected data, and may differ due to i.e., different sensors used to measure the instantaneous energy consumption, or different atmospheric conditions accounting for the process noise.

At time $k=0$, the initial estimate before measurement of the state and of the error covariance matrix is updated in Equation~(\ref{eq:kalman-pred1})~and~(\ref{eq:kalman-pred2}) respectively. The value of $\hat{\mathbf{q}}_1^-$ is then used in Equation~(\ref{eq:kalman-est2}) to estimate the current state along with the data from the sensor $y_0$ (e.g., the energy sensor of the flight controller of the fixed-wing craft), where the sensor noise covariance matrix $R$ accounts for the amount of uncertainty in the measurement. The estimated output $\hat{y}_0$ is then obtained from Equation~(\ref{eq:kalman-est4}). The algorithm is iterative. At time $k=1$ the values $\hat{\mathbf{q}}_1,P_1$ computed at previous step are used to estimate the values $\hat{\mathbf{q}}_2,P_2,$ and $y_1$.
