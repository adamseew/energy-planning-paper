# Energy-Aware Dynamic Planning Algorithm for Autonomous UAVs

This is the first rushed version of the planning algorithm [paper](pdf/iros-2021.pdf) that we plan to submit to the [IROS 2021](https://www.iros2021.org/) conference. The paper is undergoing some polishing and internal reviews. It is not peer reviewed yet.

The paper in the current shape is not for redistribution.


## Simulator

The simulator can be invoked [here](scripts/SIM8.m). It is written in Matlab.

## Data

The data from different simulations are stored [here](data/simulation3).

The path data for the path I are stored [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/static/position_simulation3Ds.csv), the energy data [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/static/energy_simulation3Ds.csv), and period data [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/static/perioddata_simulation3Ds.csv). 

For path II, the path data are stored [here](data/simulation3/raw1/new_physics/static/position_simulation3s.csv), the energy data [here](data/simulation3/raw1/new_physics/static/energy_simulation3s.csv), and period data [here](data/simulation3/raw1/new_physics/static/perioddata_simulation3s.csv).

For the algorithm simulation data I.d, the path data are stored [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/dynamic/position_simulation3D.csv), the energy data [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/dynamic/energy_simulation3D.csv), the battery data [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/dynamic/bat_simulation3D.csv),  the period data [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/dynamic/perioddata_simulation3D.csv), and the parameters data [here](data/simulation3/raw5/new_physics/dynamic/ctl_simulation3D.csv).
